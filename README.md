# BukkitPELogin
BukkitPELogin requires registration of player names using a password. That blocks faked usernames and using admin accounts.

Commands:
/register <password>: Registers your account with a password of with at least 6 characters.
/login <password>: Log into your account.
Note: This is still in Beta. So, there will be bugs.
